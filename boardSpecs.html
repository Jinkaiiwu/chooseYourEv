				<h2>The Ride</h2>If you’ve skated before, you’ll appreciate the pop in this deck which puts you in the goldilocks zone for flex. The drop-through truck design allows wheelbase adjustment to dial in your ride and enjoy the low profile feel, just how you like it. Whether you’re into short and sharp or long and deep carving, our bamboo deck has a classic longboard vibe and will give you a softer feeling underfoot than its Carbon counterpart.
